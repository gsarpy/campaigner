# campaigner
A survey campaign app for getting feedback from your customers and users!

This was a practice project to implement both a NodeJS with Express server using React on the front end. 

It's not a whole lot, but the frontend is completely React based using `create-react-app` and NodeJS/Express deployed to Heroku. 

This isn't a completed app, my ultimate goal was to connect between a client service (react) and a backend service (node/express) using different technologies and methodologies such as MongoDB/Mongoose, and Redux for React and tying that all into the Stripe payment API.

Create an account using Google, and you can add credits without paying anything using a fake CC card number of:
`4242 4242 4242 4242` any date that isn't expired e.g. if it's January 1st 2018, use an expiration date of February 2018 and any 3 digit security code. This will add 5 credits to your account.
