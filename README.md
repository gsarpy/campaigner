# campaigner
A survey campaign app for getting feedback from your customers and users!

This was a practice project to implement both a NodeJS with Express server using React on the front end. 

It's not a whole lot, but the frontend is completely React based using `create-react-app` and NodeJS/Express deployed to Heroku. 

This isn't a completed app, my ultimate goal was to connect between a client service (react) and a backend service (node/express) using different technologies and methodologies such as MongoDB/Mongoose, and Redux for React.
